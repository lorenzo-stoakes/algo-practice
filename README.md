## Sources

* [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) - Note I am a fully paid up
subscriber and the bit they charge for is emphatically _not_ shared here
(i.e. worked solutions).
* [Elements of Programming Interviews
  C++](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836) -
  A great and extremely thorough book.
